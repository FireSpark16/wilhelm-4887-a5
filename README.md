# Inventory Manager
An easy way to manage your inventory.

## What it does?
This inventory manager takes in a price, a 10 digit/letter serial number, and a name for an item and stores up to 100 of them in a table for easy viewing. You can sort this table or search for items using the search bar. You can also add new items, edit existing items, or delete items. On top of this, you can load and save various different files in different formats which will work with the application.

### Adding an Item
Navigate to the "Add" tab. Enter a price, serial number in the format XXXXXXXXXX (where X can be any number or letter), and a name. Press "Add Item" to add this item to the list.

### Editing an Item
Select an existing item from the table by clicking on it. Then navigate to the "Edit" tab. You will see the current values for the price, serial number, and name here. You can edit them as you wish, then press "Confirm Edit" to update your item.

### Deleting an Item
Select an existing item from the table by clicking on it. Then navigate to the "Delete" tab. You will see the current values for the price, serial number, and name here. Press "Delete Item" to remove this item from the list.

### Searching
Type anything into the search bar, and if it matches part of a price, serial number, or name, those results will be shown.

### Sorting
Clicking on the column names will allow you to sort the table data by the values in those columns.

### Saving
Clicking on "File" then clicking on "Save" will allow you to save your list in multiple different formats, which can be loaded later. Just give it a name and location, then click "Save" again.

### Loading
Clicking on "File" then clicking on "Load" will allow you to load a list previously created by the application. Simple find the list you want to open, select it, then click "Open".

### New List
If you are not loading a different list and want a clean slate, click "File" then "New" to give yourself a fresh slate to work with.
